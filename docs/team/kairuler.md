| Revealing a password `view`       |     ★      | To maintain security when listing passwords, the actual passwords will not be revealed. To reveal a specific password, the user inputs the name of the password to view. If the password name does not match any stored password, an error message is printed.                                                        |
| Searching for a password `search` |     ★★     | Searches for passwords with names that contain the specified name, and optionally in the specified folder. If a folder name is provided, it searches in that specific folder, otherwise it searches in all passwords. The search results are printed out in a formatted table along with the number of matches found. |
| Edit a password `edit`            |    ★★★     | To edit a password, the user inputs the name of the password, and optionally the new name and new folder of the password. The user then inputs the new values of the relevant fields to be updated (e.g. password, credit card number, NUSnet ID, etc.).                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
