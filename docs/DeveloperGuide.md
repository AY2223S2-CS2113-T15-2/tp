## [AddressBook Template](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#proposed-undoredo-feature)

The format of this Developer’s guide (DG) as well as some basic support is inspired/ taken from the AddressBook 
project’s DG.


## [Bitwarden](https://go.bitwarden.com/password-management-for-business-teams-organizations/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=AW_APAC_NU_CL_Bitwarden_en_GSN_DTMB_Brand_KW:Brand_Exact&utm_content=646898599878&utm_term=bitwarden&hsa_acc=2567950947&hsa_cam=11319090405&hsa_grp=114652450007&hsa_ad=646898599878&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-442029814536&hsa_kw=bitwarden&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRn0X9IDtuPlHiXveE0H8FMOOYNtwMBxX7lUL4yzK8zUTKH_58EV-4xoCrVkQAvD_BwE)

The idea for this product stems out from Applications like Bitwarden and the like that serve to store and protect users passwords. Many of our features were inspired by these applications.


## CLI Applications

The idea for this product is for users who are familiar with CLI environments. Users are able to see only the necessary information given in text format. Things can be done faster with just a single line of input command compared to navigating through a GUI environment.

# Setting up, getting started


## Setting up the project in your computer

First, fork this repo, and clone the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):



1. **Configure the JDK:** Follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure Intellij is configured to use JDK 11.
2. **Import the project as a Gradle project:** Follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA. \

<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/ExclamationMark.png" width="4%" />
Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
3. **Verify the setup:**
    1. Run the _seedu.address.Main_ and try a few commands.
    2. [Run the tests](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/Testing.html) to ensure they all pass.


## Before writing code



1. **Configure the coding style** \
   If using IDEA, follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to set up IDEA’s coding style to match ours. 

<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/ExclamationMark.png" width="4%" />
Tip: Optionally, you can follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems as you write code.  

2. **Set up CI** This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in .github/workflows folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the master branch or to any PR. No set up required.  
3. **Learn the design** When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about [AddressBook’s architecture](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#architecture).  
4. **Do the tutorials These tutorials will help you get acquainted with the codebase.**  
    * [Tracing code](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/tutorials/TracingCode.html)
    * [Adding a new command](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/tutorials/AddRemark.html)
    * [Removing fields](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/tutorials/RemovingFields.html)

# Design & Implementation


## Architecture

<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="100%" />


This **Architecture Diagram** explains the high-level design of the App.


### Main Components of the architecture

**SecureNUS** has 1 class called SecureNUS. It is responsible for,
* At app launch: initializing all the important components in the correct sequence and initializes the appropriate connections between them.
* It connects and sends the appropriate information and executes different actions using the other helpers via **Commands**.

**SecretStorage** is responsible for the management of Secret Objects which store information of different Secret classes, e.g. passwords, credit cards. It also manages the different underlying data structures within it that help optimize the speed of queries through indexing, etc. It consists of 3 classes: **SecretMaster, SecretSearcher** and **SecretEnumerator**, which contain the different views.



* **SecretMaster:** Manages the other views and also ensures there are no duplicates in naming where they should not exist
* **SecretSearcher:** Contains the Hashtable view for directly querying the Secret by name
* **SecretEnumerator:** Contains the ArrayList view for querying the Secret by index

The other 2 components are:



* **UI:** The main interface the user have access to through the Command Line
* **Backend:** Which handles the details regarding the initialisation and saving (or exporting) of data across sessions

<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="100%" />

### How the architecture components interact with each other

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user creates a new basic password initiated using the command `new password.`

Sequence Diagram

<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/SequenceDiagramNew.png" width="100%" />

Each of the six main components (also shown in the diagram above)

[//]: # (@@author ollayf)

* defines its API in an interface with the same name as the Component.


## UI Component

The API of this component is specified in `Ui.java`

<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/LightBulb.png" width="10%" />


The UI consists of the Ui class which handles all the inputs provided by the user. The Ui then sends information to the 
parser which will interpret the commands provided by user input. The **Parser **will create **Commands** which will be
sent to **SecureNUS** to execute some command that will alter the data in SecretStorage. The **Ui **also handles 
responses/ feedback to the User.


## SecureNUS Component

This is the main component that initialises all other components and connects them when the application is running.

## SecretStorage Component

<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/SecretStorageComponent.png" width="100%" />

The Secret Storage component abstracts the data that is to be stored into many views/ indexes. This optimizes the speed of queries for many types of queries without developers needing to access the individual data structures used. The data structures, namely Hash Table and Array are stored in the SecretSearcher and SecretEnumerator class respectively. Finally, during the initialisation of the application, the Backend will connect past data to the SecretMaster. During shutdown, the Backend will handle saving it into an encrypted file.


[//]: # (@@author stevenantya)
## Command Component

The API of this component is specified in Command.java

Command is an abstract class that is inherited by various components such as AddBasicPasswordCommand.java



<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/CommandComponent.png" width="100%" />

The Command consist of Command abstract class that handles all of its command constructors and executions through its child classes. The user inputs command in Ui, that is parsed in Parser, and then instantiated and executed in Command classes.


## Backend Component
<img src="./DGDiagramsCreator/DGUsedDiagrams/BackendComponent.png" width="100%" />


The backend manages the saving and loading of data from the database.txt file. To do so, it collates and organises information stored in the SecretMaster and encrypts it into the database.txt. When starting up, it will decrypt the database.txt file and transfer its data into the SecretMaster.

# Product Scope


## Target user profile:



* has a need to manage a significant number of passwords
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps


## Value proposition:
* SecureNUS manages passwords faster than a typical mouse/GUI-driven password manager app.
* SecureNUS manages and stores passwords locally, there is no risk of a server side failure/ attack leaking your passwords
